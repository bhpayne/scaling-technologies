# plateaus when scaling

draft book content. Just a placeholder for now.

When growing a company, foundation, team, or organization there are 
plateaus of capability. Knowing what the next step up would be useful.

For example, consider a helpdesk:
1. There is no helpdesk. You just talk with users.
1. You (as the business owner) answer the phone.
1. You have a person whose role includes answering the phone
1. There is a person whose dedicated role is answering the phone
1. There is a team of people who provide helpdesk services.

In these plateaus, when is it appropriate to scale up or down?
